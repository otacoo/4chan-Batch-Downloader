## Usage

1. **Go to a 4chan thread** (or compatible imageboard).
2. **ALT+CLICK** (or your configured modifier) on image thumbnails to select/unselect them.
3. When images are selected, floating download buttons will appear:
   - **Download Selected Images**: Download each file (with dialog).
   - **Download All (No Dialog)**: Download each file directly (no dialog, see note below).
   - **Download as ZIP**: Download all as a single ZIP archive.
4. **Cancel**: While downloading, the button turns red and can be clicked to cancel.
5. **Options**: Click the extension icon and choose "Options" to configure all settings.


## Development

### Build

- **Chrome:** `npm run build:chrome`
- **Firefox:** `npm run build:firefox`
- **Both:** `npm run build`

## Troubleshooting

- **No dialog download prompts for every file:**  
  Disable "Ask where to save each file before downloading" in your browserâ€™s settings.
- **Original filenames not used:**  
  Make sure the option is enabled in the Options page.
